# FashionMNIST Classification with PyTorch
This repository contains my projects and exercises from the "PyTorch for Beginners" course by FreeCodeCamp on YouTube. Through this course, I learned fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, focusing on PyTorch. Below are the key highlights and projects included in this repository:

## Key Concepts Covered
  - Tensors: Understanding and manipulating tensors using PyTorch.
  - PyTorch Workflows: Building and training machine learning models using PyTorch.
  - Linear Regression: Implementing and training a linear regression model.
  - Neural Networks: Basics of neural networks, including non-linearity and activation functions.
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Using CNNs for image classification tasks.

## Projects
### FashionMNIST Image Classification
  - Dataset: FashionMNIST, a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category.
  - Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch.
  - Performance: Achieved 90% accuracy on the test set.
